When I was in polytechnic, I had to design an investment app with my teammates.

This app would allow users to insert money and invest in stocks or assets.
It was rough deciding what was necessary and what we felt was needed, but

quite a bit.

![Investments](/images/sample1){group="my-gallery"}

![Personal](/images/sample2){group="my-gallery"}

![Home](/images/sample3){group="my-gallery"}
