title: "Reflection on the use of GenAI"

While I did not use genai for this assignment, I have used it in my free time on
personal projects. 

I normally use [chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com/) as my genai. Though other genai
are stronger, I find the level of responses that chatgpt are sufficient and I
did not need to go further.
There aren't many challenges to the use genai other than good prompts.
I do believe that genai is the future for helping with code, I still feel that
handwritten code tends to be better.
