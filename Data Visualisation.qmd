Using data from the [NCD](https://ncdrisc.org/data-downloads-height.html), I had
show the growth of Singaporean young adults (aged 18) over time.
I had decided not to combine the heights of both genders as I realised from
initial plotting that there was a big gap between males and females.

From the data, I had discovered that due to improving nutrition availability, 
youth height steadily increased over time. 

I used a line graph to display the height changes over time. Since the 1990s,
heights have been steadily improving for both genders, with other sources and
research, I concluded that it was due to improving dietary conditions for youths.

df <- read_csv("NCD_RisC_Lancet_2020_height_child_adolescent_country.csv")

show_sex  <- "Both"      # "Boys", "Girls", or "Both"
age_18_id <- "18"        # CHANGE if your dataset labels it differently
# ----------------------

df_sg <- df %>%
  filter(
    Country == "Singapore",
    `Age group` == age_18_id
  ) %>%
  {
    if (show_sex == "Both") .
    else filter(., Sex == show_sex)
  }

ggplot(df_sg, aes(x = Year, y = `Mean height`, color = Sex)) +

    title = "Mean Height Over Time in Singapore (Age 18)",

    y = "Mean Height (cm)",
    color = "Sex"
  ) +
