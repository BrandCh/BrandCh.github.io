Here is my favourite [Wonton Mee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RPCzzm8l9I)
recipe! I have made it myself and I found the process to be simple and fast.

Here are the steps for cooking the noodles!

* Ingredients
  + Egg noodles
  + Chicken broth
    - Chicken stock is also good
    
+ Firstly, fill the pot to about half with water.
  - Add a can of chicken stock.
  - Add the noodles
  - Shock the Noodles in an ice bath
  - Add them back into the water
And your noodles are done!
I only made the noodles as I had loved the texture from eating it outside.
However, the entire recipe is equally as easy!
